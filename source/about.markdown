I am a Technical Architect working and living in Minneapolis.  I have been developing software professionally since 1998.  I have worked and/or contracted at many fortune 500 companies including UnitedHealth Group, Best Buy, ING, Ingersol Rand, Donaldson, Jostens, Wells Fargo and many other smaller companies.  My history is diversified between .Net and Java technologies.

Most recently I have been working in Grails, Groovy, jQuery, Scala and Java.  I work on a Windows 7 PC, MacBook Pro and an Ubuntu Cloud Instance and am well versed on multiple platforms.

In addition to programming I am also an avid biker and triathlete. On July 31, 2010 I completed the Vineman 140.6.
