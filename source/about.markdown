I am a Technical Architect working and living in Minneapolis. I have been
developing software professionally since 1998. I have worked and/or
contracted at many fortune 500 companies such as UnitedHealth Group, Best Buy,
ING, Ingersol Rand, Donaldson, Jostens, Wells Fargo as well as many other
smaller companies. My history is diversified between .Net and Java
technologies.

Most recently I have been working in Grails, Groovy, jQuery, Scala and Java.
I own both a Windows 7 PC, MacBook Pro and a Ubuntu Cloud Cluster and am well
versed on multiple platforms.

In addition to programming I am also an avid biker and triathlete. On July
31, 2010 I completed the Vineman 140.6. Once and I while I like to blogabout
biking and training as those areÂ definitely more fun than boring old computer
code.
