I updated a few features to the cxf client plugin.Â  I added the following new
config parameters to help drive the wsdl2java script.

namespace = [package name to use for generated classes] //optional - uses
packages from wsdl if not provided client = [true or false] //optional - used
to tell wsdl2java to output sample clients, usually not needed - defaults to
false binding = [Specifies JAXWS or JAXB binding files or XMLBeans context
files] //optional outputDir = [location to output generated files] //optional
- defaults to src/java
